<h2 id="Entry1" style="background-color:Tomato; font-family:verdana;"> <strong> Perfect Day </strong> <em> August 20, 2019 </em> </h2>
    <p> IMAGE
    <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Today we covered a lot of ground in the beautiful city of Milwaukee. Thank God I had brought my sunglasses as it was very sunny outside which made it a perfect day to explore the Riverwalk. It was gorgeous and my pictures I took from my camara turned out great. After we walked for a while on the Riverwalk, we stopped in lots of cute stores in the Third Ward including the Milwaukee Public Market and got a bite to eat.</p>

<h2  id="Entry2" style="background-color:Tomato;font-family:verdana;"> Tourists <em> August 21, 2019 </em> </h2>
    <p> IMAGE
    <p style="font-family:verdana;"> We decided to do more <em> touristy </em> things today. I am so thankful I packed my wallet because it was about empty by the end of today. My tag along friend loved art which made the Milwaukee Art Museum a perfect destinaiton to stop at. It was well worth the stop. After the art museum, we headed over to Discovery World and had lots of fun inside the beautiful building. Next, we went over to the Harley Davison Museum which was a lot more entertaining then what I was expecting. We ended the day at the Milwaukee Zoo. It was so cool to see all the different animals at night and the beautiful lights hanging around. It was a long and exhausting day and we got one more day yet tomorrow! </p>
<!-- Journal Entry Three -->
<h2  id="Entry3" style="background-color:Tomato;font-family:verdana;"> Bucks in 6 <em> August 22. 2019 </em> </h2>
    <p> IMAGE
    <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Our last day, I got to pull out my Bucks jersey as we took a trip to the Fiserv Forum. <strong> Bucks in 6 </strong> was all I heard around the block. As I was still in my Bucks jersey, we also took a stop at Miller Park and laughed when a heard a litte kid call the water fountain a bubbler. </p>
