   Before Europeans arrived two groups of Native Americans lived in the San Francisco area, the Ohlone and the Miwok. Later in the 19th century whaling ships and traders came to the bay. In 1821 Mexico (which included California) broke away from Spain and became its own republic. In 1828 Jedediah Smith crossed the Sierra Nevada mountains to reach San Francisco Bay. William Richardson (who was an Englishman) founded a settlement by San Francisco bay in 1835. He called it Yerba Buena. During the 1830s and early 1840s many Americans came to live in the new settlement.
The USA eventually annexed California. On July 9 of 1846 USS Portsmouth sailed into San Francisco Bay and sailors and marines went ashore and raised the US flag. The little settlement of Yerba Buena was renamed San Francisco (after the bay) on January 30, 1847. At that time San Francisco only had a population of about 800. However in 1848 a man named James Marshall discovered gold. News of the find reached New York in December 1848 and as a result people went to San Francisco in their thousands and the population boomed. In 1849 the population of San Francisco reached 25,000. Alcatraz was another huge thing as it hosted many criminals on the little island in San Francisco’s history and now is a huge tourist destination.
